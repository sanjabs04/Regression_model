# Regression_model

The dataset is a regression model and predicts the prices of a given house according to different observations such as bedrooms, bathrooms, floors, and so on. In other words, these house sales situations are based on different predictors to obtain a final conclusion. In addition, we also consider these different variables if they qualify a correlation, and which values are significant, which factors will influence these house sales, as well as how to analyze linear dependencies. Particularly, according to these data testing and training, we could adjust several factors such as house square value, floors value, basement value, and so on, to obtain accurate sale value. Of course, we also predict which factors are not significant based on our data analysis. Thus, we will demonstrate an excellent sale strategy to obtain more benefits, as well as predict an anticipated sale trend.
